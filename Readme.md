# Gitops Walkthrough for tenant gke setup 
With this repository, we try to reinforce some practices that we've already seen [poc](https://github.com/Deepzima/gitops-dry-infrastructure) previously. But at this time we attempt to implement that in multi-tenant key.

## Scenario 
Acme Corp. has realized a new web solution for all their customers, to manage all data collected from their jobs.  You know... captured prey, items used and more.

## Requirement
We have to make a classic production environment, with monitor and other best practices for tenant environments. So this section can be updated every time we discover a new way to bettering the solution.
